		<p>
			Lief is an application for collecting, organising and reading comics of a digital nature- either web comics 
			or scanned comic books. There are quite a few benefits to using Lief, including:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Lief can remember what you've read, giving you the ability to randomise from a bunch of comics and never 
					read the same page twice.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can easily configure some comics to maintain order relative to themselves and randomise others
					by default, making for an intuitive concept of overall randomisation.
					
				</li>
				<li>
					Lief can provide a very minimilistic interface when reading comic pages.
				</li>
				<li>
					All of your comics are accessible from the one interface. With Lief you can be reading many comics at once. 
					While reading comics, there is no difference between scraped comics and scanned comics. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Scanned comics (i.e. multiple image archives or folders) can be imported with a few clicks. All web comics
					can be updated with one or two clicks too.
				</li>
				<li>
					Comic pages are stored on your computer, which means you can read while offline. You have free reign over
					the organisation of comic books (i.e. folder structure of the comic book directory).
				</li>
			</ul>
			This manual will take you on an in-depth tour of Lief, including the more advanced scraping features. It is 
			worth noting that if you just want to use Lief to manage scanned comics, or if you can find config files, you 
			may never have to make use of these features.
		</p>

		
		
		<!--Quick Start Example: xkcd-->
		<br><br><br>
		<a name="Quick Start Guide"><h3 class="break">Quick Start Example: xkcd</h3></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Contents" class="top">[Top]</a>
		<p>
			The following example will breeze over the details, showing you how to set up, collect and read a web 
			comic.
			<h4>1) Setting up the config file</h4>	
			Running the executable should present you with the Main Menu. From here, click to enter into the 
			Manage page.
			One of the main functions of this page is facilitating the addition of comic books to your library. For this 
			example, we'll be adding a popular web comic called <em>xkcd</em>, so fill in the name of the comic and the author 
			(Randall Munroe). Because this a web comic, we also need three fudamental pieces of 
			information. The necessary information is shown below:
		</p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="resources/img/xkcd_fields_1.png" alt="[img]"><br>
			<em>Figure 1: Lief With Fields Filled For The XKCD Web Comic</em>
		</div>
		<p>
			The Start Page field is fairly self-explanatory- it's the URL of the first page of the web comic 
			(don't forget the protocol). Note that multiple start pages and other nifty things are possible, but we only 
			need one for this example. The other two are CSS selectors. The web already contains everything you
			could care to know about CSS selectors
			(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors">Mozilla</a>,
			for example, has some great resources). Lief uses them to identify important elements while scraping. The Image 
			Selector locates the comic image on each page for Lief to download, and the Next Page Selector locates the link 
			on each page that Lief will follow to get to the next one. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The next two bits of information aren't necessary, but they do provide a good example of custom user selectors. 
			Under the Optional expando, fill the fields as shown below:
		</p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="resources/img/xkcd_fields_2.png" alt="[img]"><br>
			<em>Figure 2: Custom User Selector Fields</em>
		</div>
		<p>
			The first row selects the title for each comic, and the second row selects the hover text (to add a row, press the "+"
			button). Lief will store this information, which we can choose to display when reading the comic. 
		</p>
			<h4>2) Saving the config file</h4>
			To save the comic book details, click Menu -> Save Config To File. Lief will open the Save File
			dialog to the comic book directory, which by default is the same location the executable is in.
			Create a folder, name it "xkcd" (the folder name is inconsequential), and save the config file inside the folder. 
			<h4>3) Grabbing Comic Book Pages</h4>
			Updating the comic book is fairly simple. From the Main Menu, click into the Update page, click Select All (or 
			simply check <em>xkcd</em>), and click Update All. The scraper engine will start automatically, and information
			will start scrolling as the engine goes from the start url, collecting and saving image files. For this example, 
			only grab a few comic pages. To stop the engine, click Stop. The engine will stop scraping after it finishes
			the current batch, and you'll be able to press Back to go back to the Main Menu.
			<h4>4) Reading Comics</h4>
			From the Main Menu, click into the Read page. Click the Options button to drop down the options panel, 
			check <em>xkcd</em> and click Go. Click the Options button again to hide the options panel and you should 
			see the first xkcd comic. You'll notice the details panel showing information about this specific 
			comic page. The last two lines are the title and the hover text of the comic. You can show/hide details 
			by checking/unchecking items under Select Details in the options panel. To view comics without any clutter,
			uncheck <em>Any</em>, check <em>Hide Borders</em>, press F11 to enter full screen mode and click the Hide Buttons
			button (moving the mouse to the top or bottom of the page or pressing escape will show the buttons again). This
			will give you a completely full-screen comic image on your monitor.
			Pressing the right arrow key, D, or clicking the right hand pointer button will iterate to the next comic.
			Check the <em>Random</em> radio box to randomise the comics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many details that were glossed over here, and much functionality was left out, but hopefully
			this gave you an idea of how it feels to set up, collect and read comics using Lief.
		</p>

		
		
		<!--Settings Page-->
		<br><br><br>
		<a name="Settings"></li><h3 class="break">Settings Page</h3></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Contents" class="top">[Top]</a>
		<p>
			This page contains miscellaneous settings. There's not many- a lot of the customisation within Lief is done
			by configuring the Read page.

		<!--Manage Page-->
		<br><br><br>
		<a name="Manage"></li><h3 class="break">Manage Page</h3></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Contents" class="top">[Top]</a>
		
		<p>
			The Manage Page is your hub for creating and editing comic books.
			
			<a name="The Menu And Loading/Saving Config Files"><h4>The Menu And Creating/Loading/Saving Config Files</h4></a>
		</p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="resources/img/manage_menu.png" alt="[img]"><br>
			<em>Figure 4: Manage Page Menu </em>
		</div>
		<p>
			If you want to create a config file from scratch, simply type information into the fields as desired, press the
			Menu button and click Save Config To File. Use the resulting file browser dialogue to save the config file. The
			directory tree for comics can be arbitrarily complex, but the comic book folder must be somewhere in the 
			comic book directory (which can be changed in the Settings page) for Lief to find it. The folder in which you
			place the config file will be the folder that holds the comic pages and metadata. The path to the config file
			can be used when searching for comic books in the Manage, Update and Read pages (along with the name
			of the comic book). After saving the config file
			you should see that comic book in the list of comic books.
			<br><br>
			To load a config file external to the comics directory, click Load Config From File and navigate to the 
			file. The details will be loaded into the Manage Page fields, and from there you can save the config file to 
			a folder within the comics directory. An alternative to this would be to just name the file "config.json"
			and place it in a folder within the comics directory(Lief will find it the next time you exit the Main Menu).
			<br><br>
			To load a file from the comic books already managed by Lief (i.e. those comic books that are within the comics
			directory), simply find the row entry of the comic book you want to load (use the search box if needed) and click
			the Comic Name column of that entry. You might notice two numbers in brackets beside the Comic Name. These are
			the comics read out of the total comic pages in the comic book. Clicking the Path column of a comic book entry
			will open Windows Explorer to the comic book folder. There are three buttons under the Actions column for each
			comic book. The first, labelled "&#x1F5AB;", saves the current Manage Page fields to that comic book. 
			The second, labelled "&#x26aa;", clears the number of read comic pages of that comic book. 
			The third, labelled "&#x2620;", deletes the comic book. 
			<br><br>
			The entry row for the comic book last loaded will be displayed in the Manage Page between the Menu button and
			the Manage Page fields. Clicking Clear Fields will clear the Manage Page fields and remove the last
			loaded comic from that spot. 
		</p>
			<a name="Import/Export Configs"><h4>Import/Export Config Files</h4></a>
			Pressing the Import Config Files button will open a file dialogue, from which you can select one or 
			multiple comic book
			configuration files. These comic books will be imported into an "Imported" folder within the comic 
			book directory. (You can move them out of the "Imported" folder at your leisure. Indeed, you can arrange your
			comic books as you see fit. Lief doesn't mind.) The folder for each imported comic book will be the name of 
			the comic book as specified within the configuration file. You can rename them if you like.
			<br><br>
			Pressing the Export Config Files button will open a folder dialogue, from which you can select which folder
			to export all your config files to. The config files will be saved as whatever the name of the comic book is.
			If a comic name is skipped because it contains invalid filename characters, or the save fails for some 
			other reason, Lief will let you know.
			
			<a name="Web Comics"><h4>Web Comics: Overview</h4></a>
			There are two types of digital comic book Lief was designed to handle: web comics and scanned comics. 
			Scanned comics, discussed <a href="#Scanned Comics">later</a>, are made of image files sourced
			manually. Web comics, on the other hand, are automatically sourced from the web by the built-in scraper
			within Lief. For this reason, extra information is required in the comic book configuration files of 
			web comics. There are also configuration options to compensate for the varying nature of web comic sites. 
			By tuning these configurations, you should be able to scrape most web comics- dynamically generated
			sites are out of Lief's current capabilities.
			<br><br>
			Note: Lief makes much use of CSS selectors. I've made a small but useful extension to make getting a 
			CSS selector from a page easier than frolicking through inspector tools or the page source- you can just
			right click on an element, such as the comic image, grab the CSS selector and paste it straight into
			Lief. You can find more information <a href="#CSS Selector Tool">here</a>.
			<br><br>
			Here is an example of the information required for Lief to manage a web comic:
		</p>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img src="resources/img/xkcd_fields_1.png" alt="[img]"><br>
			<em>Figure 5: Lief With Required Fields Filled For The XKCD Web Comic</em>
		</div>
		<p>
		
			<a name="Transition Delay"><h4>Web Comics: Default Transition Delay</h4></a>
			This is the delay (in seconds) that Lief will wait in the "auto" Hands-Free mode, where Lief defers to each comic on how long
			to wait. It should be a positive integer, though leaving it blank or putting 0 will just make Lief defer instead to the current
			default transition time.
			
			<a name="Scroll Delay"><h4>Web Comics: Default Scroll Delay</h4></a>
			Lief will pause scrolling before moving to the next comic and within a comic page at set intervals.
			This is the delay for which Lief will pause at these times.
			
			<a name="Start Pages"><h4>Web Comics: Start Pages</h4></a>
			The Start Page field should contain the URL of the page that Lief will start at when scraping for 
			comic pages. Most of the time, this will be the first page of the web comic, but it's possible to start from 
			anywhere. The protocol (the "http://" part) is necessary. Multiple start pages can be given, separated by 
			pressing ENTER (i.e. separated by newline characters). Lief crawls as far is he can go from the 
			first start page. Once he runs out pages or fails for some other reason he will start at the next
			start page given and continue, repeating until he runs out of start pages. Enter each start url
			on a new line.
			<br><br>
			A Start Page entry can also be a pattern that will be expanded during a crawl. These patterns are of the 
			form <code>[string]^[[string]^...] where min1-max1[,min2-max2, ...]</code> which generates a list of 
			strings where the nth ^ has been replaced by the nth given range, inclusive. For example, 
			"https://example.com/^/ where 1-5" would generate: 
			<ul>
				<li>https://example.com/1/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/2/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/3/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/4/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/5/</li>
			</ul>
			and "https://example.com/^/^/ where 0-1,5-6" would generate:
			<ul>
				<li>https://example.com/0/5/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/0/6/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/1/5/</li>
				<li>https://example.com/1/6/</li>
			</ul>
			There can be no spaces between the ranges. Note that it doesn't matter if a start page doesn't 
			exist (except the first one)- Lief will calmly step over it. Relying on these patterns can be efficient if you leave the Next Page Selector blank.
			
			<a name="Normal Selectors"><h4>Web Comics: Image And Next Page Selectors</h4></a>
			The Image Selector field should contain a CSS selector specific to comic image (or images) you want
			from each page. It is worth remembering that this selector should end with <code>img</code> because
			the element should be an image element. (If you're using the CSS Selector tool and it gives you a string that
			ends with anything other than <code>img</code> it won't work. In most case, you may just need to trim elements
			from the end of the selector.)
			<br><br>
			The Next Page Selector field should contain the CSS selector for the <code>a</code> element that 
			holds the link to the next page of the web comic.
			In many cases, there will be an obvious "Next" button on the web comic page. The anchor from this element
			will be the one you want. As with the Start Page field, you may have to trim elements until the <code>a</code>
			is the last element in the string if you're using the CSS Selector tool. 
			
			<a name="Extra Selectors"><h4>Web Comics: Extra Selectors</h4></a>
			For some web comics, you may want to scrape extra text information with each page. Common examples would be 
			titles and hovertexts (A.K.A tooltip messages). These extra pieces of information will be shown along
			with the comic title, authors etc. whilst reading. Note that, for sites with multiple comics per page,
			Lief will match the nth comic image with the nth matched selector: if the kth comic image failed for some
			reason, the kth selector is ignored. If there is no nth matched selector the first matching selector is used. 
			Under the Optional expando you will find an area called Extra Selectors:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/manage_extra_selectors.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 6: Extra Selectors</em>
			</div>
		<p>
			There are three fields for each Extra Selector:
			<ul>
				<li>The first field, labelled "CSS Selector" in Figure 6, should contain the CSS selector for the 
					element containing the information you want to scrape for. 
				</li>
				<li>If the second field, labelled "Attribute" in Figure 6, is left empty, Lief will grab the inner text of the 
					selected element. If an attribute is given, Lief will grab the value of that attribute. Note that 
					if an attribute	is given, then a CSS selector must also be provided. So, for example, if you wanted 
					the hovertext of the comic image, the CSS selector would be the same as the Image Selector field and 
					the attribute would be "title". But if you wanted the text inside a <code>p</code> or <code>div</code> 
					element, the attribute field should be blank and the CSS selector would be something that selects the 
					desired element. 
				</li>
				<li>The third field is a checkbox labelled "Include Children". This only comes into effect if the attribute
					field is empty and, therefore, the inner text of a HTML element is going to be retrieved. Sometimes,
					you want to include the inner text of descendant elements, and sometimes you don't. Check this
					if you do.
				</li>	
			</ul>
			
			<a name="Anchor Selector"><h4>Web Comics: Anchor Selector</h4></a>
			Most webcomic sites are simple: there is a page with a single image and a "Next" button that leads to the 
			next page and image:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/manage_anchor_selector_1.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 7: Example Of Webcomic Site, Simple Case</em>
			</div>
		<p>
			Some sites, however, have top-level pages containing the "Next" button that contain multiple links to 
			tangent pages holding the comic pages:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/manage_anchor_selector_2.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 8: Example Of Webcomic Site Requiring Anchor Selector</em>
			</div>
		<p>
			Thus, for each top-level page, Lief needs to go into each link and grab
			the data from that page (using the normal selectors). If this is the case, all you need to do is add in the 
			CSS selector for the anchors in the top-level pages to the Anchor Selector field.
			
			
			<a name="Cookies"><h4>Web Comics: Cookies</h4></a>	
			You will require cookies for certain websites to get past some kind of barrier. These would usually be 
			websites that when you first visit them in a browser, you have to do something or 
			agree to something, and then after that your browser "magically" remembers that you did that thing. 
			I'll use Garfield as an example. Garfield has just started splashing their page with this:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/garfield_splash.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 9: Example Of Splash Page - Perhaps Cookies Will Get Lief Around This?</em>
			</div>
		<p>
			Lief won't handle this stuff for you, but there is a way around it. If you enter in a random year, month
			and day, you'll be able to pass through into the normal website and you should notice that it 
			remembers you - but only if you use the same browser. This is because the browser stores that piece of 
			information in a cookie, that the website can access. We need to give that cookie to Lief, so he 
			can proffer it up to the website instead of having to fill in any forms. A quick Google search 
			will show you how to have a peek at the cookies your browser is storing for a certain website. Get the name
			and value of the relevant cookie/s. Copy and 
			paste each cookie name-value pair into the textbox labelled Cookies with each name separated from its value
			by an equals sign, and each cookie separated by a semi-colon (e.g. <code>name1=value1;name2=value2;</code>).
			Here is the Garfield example (note, the value is a long string, obviously encoded/encrypted in some way, and
			will be different depending on what date you picked as your birthday):
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/garfield_cookies_example.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 10: Garfield Equipped With Cookie</em>
			</div>
		<p>	
			Just as another example using a webcomic called Tranfusions, we can get around this:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/transfusions_splash.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 11: Tranfusion Popup</em>
			</div>
		<p>	
			by setting Lief up like this:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/transfusions_cookies_example.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 12: Transfusion Equipped With Cookie</em>
			</div>
		<p>		
			Most of the time you won't need cookies, but I couldn't leave Lief unable to grab Garfield comics!!
			
			
			<a name="Other Options"><h4>Web Comics: Other Options</h4></a>		
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Image Attribute</th>
					<td>
						This is optional because it default to "src", assuming that your Image Selector
						selects an mage element. This may not always be the case. Sometimes you may have
						lists of anchor tags to retrieve the image urls from (such is the case with 
						<a href="http://hipsterhitler.com/comics/">Hipster Hitler</a>). In these cases your selector
						may select the anchor tag, and you would type "href" into the Image Attribute field (you would
						also check Get All Matching Images).
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Next Page Selector (First Page)</th>
					<td>
						Sometimes, the first page of a webcomic will have a slightly different template than other pages.
						In particular, there may be less anchors in the navigation section, as the "Previous" and
						"First" buttons aren't active. Things like this can mess with your Next Page selector when you
						have nth-of-type(n) in it. To solve this, put the correct CSS Selector for the first page's
						"Next" anchor in this text box. By default, Lief will only use this if he's on the first of
						the lsit of Start Pages. If you want Lief to use this special Selector for all Start Pages, 
						check Apply To All Start Pages.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Stop URL</th>
					<td>
						In the normal case, Lief will just continue to crawl until something goes wrong- usually
						because he simply runs out of pages. However, sometimes you want to split a comic book
						into different chapters, or for some other reason you may want the crawler to stop at a 
						certain comic page. Place a URL into this field and the Lief will stop at that page (non-inclusive).
						Note that if multiple start pages are given, the stop page has to be after the last 
						start page for it be effective. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Forbidden/Required Strings In Image URL</th>
					<td>
						This field serves to add another layer of selectivity on top of the CSS selector system. If you're
						finding that Lief is downloading all the correct comic page images, plus some unwanted 
						images, refining the CSS selector for the image might prove ineffective. Analysing the situation 
						might reveal that all the unwanted images share a section (or sections) of URL. By putting that 
						string (or those strings) in this field, Lief will avoid those images.
						<br><br>
						Sometimes the urls would be more effectively narrowed down by specifying strings that <em>must</em>
						be found within the image url. Place them within the Strings Required field. For this to be
						effective you will most likely want to check the Get All Matching Images box; if you don't,
						Lief will only grab the first comic image from the page that matches the Image CSS Selector.
						<br><br>
						Note that Lief can handle multiple forbidden and required strings - simply place each string on
						a new line.

			<a name="Scanned Comics"><h4>Scanned Comics: Overview</h4></a>
			Webcomics only make up a portion of digital comics you might like Lief to manage. Scanned comics represent
			the other portion, and differ from webcomics in their method of collection. Webcomics require some initial 
			effort in configuration so that Lief can automatically scrape for comic pages; scanned comics rely on you, 
			the user, to manually source images and import them yourself. Note that these images will generally come 
			from the web too, in the form of image batches, but they may come from comics you've scanned into the 
			computer yourself. Lief provides the functionality to import batches once you've downloaded/scanned them in.
			
			<a name="Import Archives"><h4>Scanned Comics: Import Archives</h4></a>
			Clicking the Import Archives button will bring up a file browser dialogue, from which you can select one or
			multiple compressed archives (which should contain images). Lief supports the same file types as 
			7zip. Not that importing archives can take a little bit because a) decompressing files just generally
			takes a while, as I'm sure you know, and b) Lief copies everything over to a temporary folder so as to
			leave your archive files untouched. 
			<br><br>
			Each archive will be processed into its own folder within the "Imported" folder, which resides in the comics
			directory. The folder will be named the same name as the original archive unless that folder already 
			exists, in which case "_X" will be appended where X is the lowest number to avoid name collision.
			<br><br>
			.cbz and .cbr files are of ZIP and RAR types under the hood, respectively. If you attempt to import a set of 
			archive files with these extensions and Lief says they failed because he "could not open archive", then
			you may want to check whether the .cbr files are RAR and not ZIP types. Same goes for the .cbz files. You
			can see what type they are by opening them in 7zip.
			
			<a name="Import Folder"><h4>Scanned Comics: Import Folder</h4></a>
			Clicking Import Folder will open a folder browser dialogue, allowing you to select a folder to import. The folder
			can contain an arbitrarily complex directory tree, but each folder within the tree should contain
			either folders or images, and not both (Lief does ignore files with a ".json" extension, 
			meaning you can import a comic book folder, although you could simply copy the folder you want to import
			into your comics directory). The tree will be copied into the "Imported" folder within the
			comics directory, and each folder that contains images will be made into a new comic book (essentially 
			by giving it a basic config file, renaming the images and creating the metadata file required for the images).
			Each comic book will be given the name of the folder in which the images reside. The folder name can be changed
			after an import, and the comic book name can be changed from within Lief by loading it into the Manage Page. 
			
			<a name="Add Pages"><h4>Scanned Comics: Add Pages</h4></a>
			Importing archives and folders creates new comic books. If you want to add images to existing comic books, 
			you must use the Add Pages button. The Add Pages button is only enabled when a comic book has been loaded
			into the Manage Page. Clicking it will open a file browser dialogue, from which you can select one or
			multiple image files. These image files will be added to the comic book that was last loaded into the 
			Manage Page. 
			
			<a name="Fix Missing Pages"><h4>Fix Missing Pages</h4></a>
			There may be times when an image is accidentally deleted from a comic book. The first sign of this having
			occured will most likely be you running into the following image whilst reading:
		</p>
			<div class="image-container">
				<img src="resources/img/image_not_found.png" alt="[img]"><br>
				<em>Figure 13: Image Not Found Notification</em>
			</div>
		<p>	
			In the Manage Page, after a comic book has been loaded, the Fix Missing Pages button will become enabled. 
			Clicking it will present you with a maximum of two options. If you check the Delete Missing box and press Fix,
			the metadata for any missing images will be expunged. Generally, this option should be selected if you
			deleted pages from the comic book on purpose. The second option, only available for webcomics, is to Attempt
			Restoration. This option will attempt to re-download any missing images from the place where the original image
			was downloaded. This second option is analagous to manually sourcing, renaming and replacing missing images 
			for scanned comics. 
			
			<a name="Read Configurations"><h4>Read Configurations</h4></a>
			There are two options available on the Manage Page that affect default settings when reading comics. 
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Fill Images To Width By Default When Reading</th>
					<td>
						Checking this option denotes that, by default, comic images will be stretched to fill the width
						of the image area, meaning you have to scroll to reach the bottom of the page (images are 
						generally longer than they are wide). Some comics are best viewed without the need
						for scrolling. Others are best viewed as scrolling pages- these are
						usually webcomic that have designed as pages, or scanned comic books. This sets the default
						for the comic book, which can be overrode in the Read Page. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Randomise By Default</th>
					<td>
						Some comics have an innate order, whilst others don't need any context to make sense. Comics that
						contain stories generally shouldn't be randomised. If you configure some comics to maintain 
						order and others to randomise by default, it is easy to read ordered and randomised comics together,
						where the ordered comics stay ordered relative to themselves. Again, all of this can be overridden 
						from the Read Page itself.
					</td>

		<!--Update Page-->
		<br><br><br>
		<a name="Update"></li><h3 class="break">Update Page</h3></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Contents" class="top">[Top]</a>
		
		<p>
			From the Update Page, select which comic books to update before pressing Update. Lief will proceed to update
			the selected comics in a round-robin fashion, grabbing one batch from each comic book before moving to the 
			next. Whether verbose mode is on or off (set in the Settings Page) will dictate the amount of messages
			you see scrolling up the console window. Lief will crawl each comic book until it fails. When it fails for
			all comic books (and there are no more start pages to continue with) you'll be able to go back to the Main Menu.
			When a crawl fails, the specifics of the failure may not make sense as displayed in the console window. The 
			specifics of the error don't really matter- most of the time it just means there are no more pages to scrape 
			along that route. To stop the crawl before this happens, press Stop and wait for Lief to reach an exit point.
			<br><br>	
			Note that it may take a while to initially load the comic books. This is because Lief actually
			retrieved the first web page he will visit as part of the validation process. A little patience will
			see you through this. 
			<br><br>
			Pressing ? while holding control will toggle the visibility of the textbox scrollbar. While you are holding
			in control, the scrollbar won't scroll to the bottom after each line is output, making it easier to 
			scroll through the console while Lief is updating.

		<p>	
			<a name="Selecting Comics To Read"><h4>Selecting Comics To Read</h4></a>
			All your comics will be listed as checkboxes
			from which you can select the comic books you'd like to read. 
			By default, the comics are listed alphabetically. Clicking Sort By Date will sort them by date last read
			(hovering over a comic book will show you what that date is), and typing into the search box will narrow 
			the selection to those containing the search string in their path or its name (as the name of a comic
			book does not have to be the name of the folder in which it has been placed). 
			Clicking All/None will select/deselect all the
			comic books in the current selection list, so if you've narrowed the list those not selected won't be affected.
			The numbers in the brackets are (Number Of Comic Pages Read / Total Number Of Comic Pages).
			<br><br>
			If you only want a certain number of comic pages from each book to be loaded (if, for example, you have 100 of one
			comic and 30 of another but want an even spread of each) type the number of comic pages you'd like in the
			Limit Number textbox. Note that this works well with randomisation: basically, Lief removes read comic 
			pages (if need be) and randomises (if need be) before picking the specified number of comic pages from each comic
			book. Then the whole pool is randomised (if need be). Clicking Go will move Lief to act on your 
			specifications and present you with your first comic page (if there are any to show).
			
			<a name="Read Options"><h4>Read Options</h4></a>
			By default, Lief will not save any comic pages you read, nor will he filter out any comics marked as read. 
			Checking Filter Read will move Lief to remove any comic pages marked as read the next time you press 
			Go. Checking Save Read will move Lief to mark the comic pages you've read as read the next time you
			press Go and/or the next time you press &#xab; to exit the Read Page (this means you can change your mind
			about this while reading). These two checkboxes are part of the set of variables saved as user settings
			if you've told Lief he should save such things (see <a href="#Settings">here</a></li> for more information on that).
			<br><br>
			The Comic Order option specifies Lief's randomisation behaviour. Each comic book has a default setting, 
			which can be changed from the Manage Page- either they should be randomised, or not. You can set Comic Order 
			to Default if you want Lief to respect this behaviour; Sorted will force ordering (note, comic pages are 
			ordered by comic page number and then by comic book name); Random will force randomisation of all comic books. 
			Lief does not save this as a user setting and the default is, fittingly, Default. 
			<br><br>
			One interesting and useful feature of Lief presents itself when you set Comic Order to Default, and select 
			some comic books that should be randomised and some comic books that should be ordered. Lief will randomise 
			all the comic pages, but comic books that should be ordered will keep their order releative to other comic 
			pages in the same book. Note that forcing randomisation will override this behaviour. 
			<br><br>
			The Width textbox sets the maximum width of the image, and works with the Bounding type to configure how a comic image is presented. You can
			either write AUTO or an integer in the textbox and press ENTER. If AUTO, the width is determined by whatever Bounding type
			is selected (these Bounding types can be selected with the button in the top right corner, and are 
			discussed <a href="#Bound/unbound">here</a>). If an integer
			is entered, that will determine the maximum width of the image. Bound and Unbound
			functionality will work the same - the only difference is the maximum width of the comic images.
			<br><br>
			Enter a scroll delay into the Scroll Delay textbox to override any comic-specific configurations or keep AUTO to 
			respect comic-specific configurations (press ENTER to enact change). This is the the number of seconds to wait
			before going to the next page (if hands-free is enabled) and before starting to scroll on a new page (if scroll speed is greater than 0).
			<br><br>
			Check Hannds Free to enable hands-free mode. With this feature turned on, Lief will automatically
			turn the page after a delay (the delay begins when image has been scrolled). The delay is the same amount of time
			that Lief would pause a scroll for.
			<br><br>
			Remember- the textbox settings come into effect when you press enter with the cursor focused in them.
			
			<a name="Select Details"><h4>Select Details</h4></a>
			By default, Lief will will show you all the information he can about a comic page: the name, the author(s), the
			comic page URL, and any other information retrieved using custom selectors (see <a href="#Selectors">here</a>). 
			This tends to look cluttered. You can selectively remove pieces of information by deselecting checkboxes
			from Select Details (6). Deselecting Any will remove the entire Details Pane. Lief remembers which  
			details were checked/unchecked as user settings. Lief also remembers the state of the checkboxes for custom
			selectors for each specific comic book- these are reset each time you enter the Read Page and are not 
			stored in user settings. In this way, you can specify whether you want to see authors etc. as you read,
			and you can specify which extra bits of information for each comic book you want to see.
			<br><br>
			Checking Hide Scroll (7) will stop the scrollbar from appearing, even when a comic is too big to fit on the 
			screen. If you check this, you can still scroll using arrow keys make use of automatic scrolling via the 
			spacebar. Note that manually zooming in will cause scrollbars to appear regardless of the state of this 
			option, but the scrollbars will disappear again once zoom has gone back to normal. 
			The Hide Borders checkbox (7) makes the border around the image dissapear- just another thing that might
			look cluttered to some people. These are both options that Lief remembers as user settings. 
			<br><br>
			Speaking of clutter, clicking Hide Buttons (next to the Menu button) will hide all the buttons on the Read Page. 
			You can re-show them by moving the cursor to the top or bottom of the page. The shortcut key to toggle 
			hide the buttons is N.
			
			<a name="Bound/unbound"><h4>Bound/Unbound Pages</h4></a>
			Some comics are best viewed without the need for scrolling. Others are best viewed as scrollable pages- 
			these are usually webcomics that have been designed as pages, or scanned comic books/manga. Each comic book has 
			a default setting telling Lief whether to stretch the comic pages to fill the width of the
			image area, meaning pages are bigger and you will probably have to scroll to reach the bottom of the 
			page. Otherwise Lief will fit the whole image such that you don't need to scroll
			(in both cases, aspect ratio is repected). The top right button of the Read Page toggles Lief's bounding
			behaviour from Default (which respectes each individual comic book's default setting) to Unbound (which 
			fills images to the width of the image area) to Bound (which contains the image such that no scrolling
			is needed). The shortcut key to toggle Bound/Unbound/Default is M.
			
			<a name="Favourites"><h4>Favourites</h4></a>
			While reading, you may come across comic pages that you want to save for future reference (mostly,
			this pertains to pages from comic books that have no inherent order). Pressing the &#x2764; button
			while copy the comic page to a Favourites folder in the comics directory (creating it if it doesn't
			already exist). This then becomes part of the Favourites comic book, which can be treated like a normal
			comic book. 
			
			<a name="Navigation"><h4>Navigating, Zooming and Scrolling</h4></a>
			Navigating through the loaded comic pages is fairly intuitive: you can use the buttons on the bottom
			toolbar, the arrow keys, or the A and D keys. To zoom in, press the + key. To zoom out, press the - key. 
			To reset the zoom level to normal, press the 0 key. If the image is zoomed in so that there is room to
			scroll horizontally, the arrow keys will contol the scrollbar rather than navigate to the next comic page.
			You may notice that there is no standard increment by which an image is zoomed. This is because Lief 
			deals with many different types of images of many different dimensions and quality.
			<br><br>
			Scrolling works in the intuitive way. Lief also provides automatic scrolling: pressing Spacebar will
			start/stop the automatic scrolling. Pressing &lt; and &gt; will slow and speed up the scroller, respectively.
			If the image is scrolled to the bottom when you press Spacebar, Lief will move to the next comic page, pause for
			a bit, and then continue scrolling.

				<li>If Lief fails to start, make sure there are no broken configuration files in the comics directory.
					You can run Lief from anywhere, but note that if the comics directory is "." (which it defaults
					to), the comics directory becomes the directory of the <em>working directory</em> - i.e. the place
					from where you ran Lief. If you run Lief from a shortcut file, the directory of that shortcut file
					would become the comics directory. You can change this by setting the comics directory explicity.

			<a name="Tips"></li><h4>Configuration Tips</h4></a>
			Having multiple start pages helps extend a comic book using the same config parameters. If you ever need to 
			extend a comic book across sites, you can scrape the comics with two different config files and import the images
			from one to the other.
			<br><br>
			As a general rule of thumb, larger CSS Selectors will mean faster crawl times.
			
			<a name="CSS Selector Tool"></li><h4>CSS Selector Tool</h4></a>	
			I made a browser extension that attempts to generate a CSS Selector for a given element on the page. It isn't
			perfect, but I've found it useful. I've talked about it already <a href="#Web Comics">here</a>. 
			I haven't made it available via any official repositories online yet, but I will include it with 
			Lief (you can delete it without hassle). You will have to load it in manually for each browser session 
			that you want to use it in.
			<ul>
				<li>In Firefox, go the address "about:debugging", click Load Temporary Add-on, navigate to a folder
				called "copy-css-selector" (it will be with the Lief executable), open that folder and double-click on any
				file in that folder. You will see "CSS Selector" appear in the list of leaded extensions. </li>
				<li>In Chrome, click the Menu icon (three vertival dots) -> More Tools -> Extensions. Navigate to the 
				"CSS Selector" folder, select it and press Okay. You may have to check Enable in the newly
				created	"CSS Selector" entry in the list of extensions.</li>
			</ul>
			Once loaded, you can right-click on elements and a new menu option will be there: "Grab CSS Selector". This
			will present an alert box containing a CSS selector for that element. Most of the time, it works fairly well, but
			you may have to edit the selector yourself (if, for example, you're after a selector for the "next page"
			anchor, and the selector ends with something like <code>a[rel="Next"] div</code> then removing the
			<code>div</code> should make it select the anchor properly).
