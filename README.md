# What Is It?

 Lief is an application for collecting, organising and reading comics of a digital nature- either web comics or scanned comic books. There are quite a few benefits to using Lief, including:

+ Lief can remember what you've read, giving you the ability to randomise from a bunch of comics and never read the same page twice.
+ You can easily configure some comics to maintain order relative to themselves and randomise others by default, making for an intuitive concept of overall randomisation.
+ Lief can provide a very minimilistic interface when reading comic pages.
+ All of your comics are accessible from the one interface. With Lief you can be reading many comics at once. While reading comics, there is no difference between scraped comics and scanned comics.
+ Scanned comics (i.e. multiple image archives or folders) can be imported with a few clicks. All web comics can be updated with one or two clicks too.
+ Comic pages are stored on your computer, which means you can read while offline. You have free reign over the organisation of comic books (i.e. folder structure of the comic book directory).
+ Lief has an adjustable auto-scroll feature, enabling you to read a comic page hands-free
+ Lief can also go to the next page automatically, making it even more hands-free. You can even have him running in a digital photo frame!

# Documentation

Full documentation can be found as a html page in the Documentations folder- once you've downloaded the repo, just open it in your favourite browser.

# CSS Selector

This can be deleted if you want- it's just a tool that I wrote to help me find good selectors for web comic config files. It works surprisingly well given its simplicity, but I do tend to just use a browser's inspecror and look for myself.

# Config Collection

These are just a few configs I've created that worked at the time of uploading. I'll try to keep them updated, but the web is a fickle beast so no guarantees these will work.

# Other Info

I just wanted to read comics from a single place- and without clicking next all the time. In essence, I wanted to mindlessly and lazily consume comics so I spent a few months straight working my ass off... the life of a typical hobbyist programmer, I might guess. I recognise that Lief potentially strips ad revenue from authors, and I'm conflicted about it. I do require an author be specified for each comic and in lieu of asking for donations to support MY work, I ask that you support the work of your favourite content creators, without which Lief would mean little.
